# QTLab2223 - Single IR photon detection
Laboratory of Solid State and Quantum Technologies  
Laboratory class for the Master's degree in Physic at the University of Milano-Bicocca.  

Some non - standard packages are being used. These are:

```markdown
$\begin{itemize}
\item cmath
\item math
\item iminuit
\item time
\item numpy
\item h5py
\item matplotlib
\item scipy.special
\item scipy.constants
\end{itemize}$
```


The experience consists in detecting a single photon using mKIDs resonators on a chip in supersonducting regime. The first thing to do is to characterize our device, namely find the $\textbf{quality factor}$ of our resonators. In order to do so, we proceeded as illustrated in 
```bash
QTLab2223/SingleIRdetection/notebooks/characterization.ipynb
```
